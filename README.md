# Dreamy - VS Code theme in 3 flavors for Aesthetes

![Dreamy](https://github.com/AmazingVanish/dreamy/raw/master/assets/hero.png)

An unobtrusive, neutral theme with vivid highlights and subtle syntax highlighting that comes in three variants to suit most tastes: *light*, *median*, and *dark*.

## Installation

In your terminal, enter the following:

```shell
ext install dreamy
```

Alternatively you can trigger the Extensions Manager in your Activity Bar or from the menu and search for Dreamy, then click the install button.

Next press &#8984;-K &#8984;-T (CTRL-K CTRL-T on Windows) or go to `Preferences > Color Theme > Dreamy Dark (or Dreamy Light or Dreamy Median)`.

## Philosophy

These color theme variants utilize solid grey colors for the UI chrome so as not to be distracting. (No dark tints, just shades of grey) From there a single pleasant color was chosen from the previous DSV standard palette and an entirely new, complimentary palette was created using tetradic color theory based on that color.

This full palette can be seen in the [DreamyColorPalette.html](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingVanish/dreamy/master/DreamyColorsPalette.html) file in the root directory alongside this read me. If you want to use this palette for your own works, a CSS file with classes relevant to each color is also provided in the root as [DreamyColorsPalette.css](https://github.com/AmazingVanish/dreamy/blob/master/DreamyColorPalette.css)

The reason for this choice was to provide an unobtrusive application chrome with vibrant highlights and subtle low lights and a pleasing pastel color palette (with vibrant colors when attention is needed or importance should be conveyed) for syntax highlighting based on color theory to ensure no jarring effects would be produced.

The key driving factor behind creating these theme variants was to make a coding environment I found aesthetically pleasing to work in. With that said, no consideration was given to color-blindness or contrast impairment. This is an unapologetically opinionated theme and will remain that way.

## About The Variants

Provided in this package are 3 color theme variants to suit multiple tastes. There is a Light theme for those who prefer coding white a dark on light display. Next is the Median theme for those who prefer a darker middle ground in their chrome and display. Finally there is the Dark theme that started this whole project. It gets out of your way and lets you code, drawing your attention as needed.

It should also be mentioned that the font used during development is JetBrains Mono, switching between Regular nd Extra Bold for testing. I highly recommend this free font designed specifically for coding, especially if you like ligatures. It is clean and well thought out and after years of using other fonts, I don't see a reason not to make this my permafont.
